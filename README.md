# Attendance using Face Recognition
Face detection and face recognition are the most widely used features of machine learning(ML) and deep learning(DL). These features are slowly gaining popularity in fields like surveillance through CCTV cameras, mobile phone security (biometric locks), etc.In this pandemic it is not possible to use bio metric because it can spread the corona virus.So,I have made an attendance system that takes attendance using face recognition and sends a message to registered users using an API if the model has recognised them. 

## Requirements
It require following libraries
* pandas
* numpy
* openCV
* Haar Cascade
* os
* IPython
* Face Regonition library
* Twillo or any other SMS service

## Results
The system works as an intelligent system eliminating any manual errors, reducing the workload. Being fully automated, the system works more efficiently. The proposed system focused on eliminating the traditional record books, RFID based system, or biometric fingerprint system.[17]

Many smart systems were created using different methods and were compared to the other methods available, hence we can conclude that haar like features worked best for the proposed system. This model is less time consuming, more precise, and
efficient. I have  published a research paper with my other team members in **ICCRDA-2020** conference.

The use of high-resolution cameras, Raspberry pi 3 modules, or ANDROID-XU4 can be used to increase the performance of the system. For the limited and accurate working of the system, remote control can be used. Adding the iris detection technique to the model will make the model accurate, increasing the accuracy of the model.
